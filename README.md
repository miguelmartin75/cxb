## Development

For development setup, building, and testing see [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Coverage

Run `./scripts/ci/coverage.sh` to build the project with clang coverage instrumentation and generate `coverage.txt`. CI uploads this report as an artifact for the Linux clang Debug job.

## Fuzzing

Build fuzz targets and run a short smoke test:

```
cmake -S . -B build -DCXB_BUILD_FUZZERS=ON
cmake --build build
./build/hashmap_fuzz -max_total_time=60
```
